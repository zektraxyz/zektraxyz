## About Zektra

Zektra is a **ZK Compute Factory** that enables encrypted AI model training with zero-knowledge proofs. We're building the infrastructure for privacy-preserving AI where data owners can monetize their datasets while maintaining complete privacy and control.

Using **homomorphic encryption (HE)** and **zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)**, Zektra allows training AI models directly on encrypted data without ever decrypting it—proving mathematically that every computation was executed correctly.

---

## 🎯 Vision

To unlock the world's most valuable datasets—medical, financial, corporate, and personal—without ever exposing them, enabling a new era of trustless AI innovation and data monetization.
